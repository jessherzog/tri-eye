====geometry changes====
pupils change in size

====graphics primitives movement====
pupils move across the screen, according to the mouse position

====color====
created RGB colors using ofColor

====gradients====
created the background using a circular gradient

====sound====
added sound upon building the sketch and looping it

====collision====
attempted to keep the moving pupils inside the eyes.

====video====
the sparkling water is a video I took on a boat, and masked into an ellipse in Premiere Pro

====attempt at serial====
because I made this code by altering Prof Michael’s gyroscope code, there were parts that were already setup to be used with the Serial port in Arduino. I changed the port name to correspond to my own, but didn’t get a chance to test the code with actual circuitry)

====attempt at more sound====
after making the serial connection work, my next step would be to connect these gyro axis with the tones in the sketch’s song.
